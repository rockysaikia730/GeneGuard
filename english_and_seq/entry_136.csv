Here's the output with the DNA sequence embedded in arbitrary text:

The other day, while wandering through the digital archives, I stumbled upon this fascinating string... it looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place it... maybe some old code? Wait, here it is: TCCTTTTATAAACAGGAACGTCTATGATCCGCAGTATGACCGCCTACGCCCGGCGTGAAATCAAGGGTGAATGGGGGAGCGCAACCTGGGAAATGCGCTCGGTAAACCAGCGTTATCTGGAAACTTACTTTCGTCTGCCGGAGCAGTTCCGTAGCCTTGAACCTGTCGTTCGCGAGCGTATTCGTTCTCGCCTGACGCGCGGTAAAGTGGAATGTACCCTGCGCTATGAGCCAGATGTTAGCGCGCAAGGTGAGCTGATCCTCAACGAAAAACTGGCTAAACAGCTG. Anyways, that got me thinking about linguistics and cryptography, and how much they share in common! What do you think?
