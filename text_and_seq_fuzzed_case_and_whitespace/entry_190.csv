The lab report detailed the PCR results, which were honestly a little sus. We needed to confirm the amplicon, so we sent it for sequencing. The raw output was... well, C2gc2gc gc aTgtG2CTGC

ATc3TGaT here it is:  Okay, now gotta blast this. I really hope it's what we think it is. Otherwise, it's back to the drawing board and re-designing the primers. Ugh.
