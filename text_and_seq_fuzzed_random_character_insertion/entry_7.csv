The initial readout looked something like this, incredibly complex for the untrained eye, but essential for our ongoing research into cellular pathways and protein synthesis validation:  See? It's all there. All the code. So many letters, but they mean so much. This tiny strand, it holds the secrets. Secrets of life, maybe? Who knows. We just write them down. Copy-paste. No change. Never change. Imperative. No errors allowed. Even a single nucleotide out of place could alter everything. Think about it. The ripple effect. A cascade. So, we guard it, this information. A treasure.
