It is embedded within descriptive and varied surrounding text.

. This sequence, a string of nucleotides, is of interest for its length and composition. It’s a fascinating puzzle of letters. Here it is again, just to be sure you've seen it: . A very specific arrangement, indeed. What do you think? Quite the sequence. Another chunk of text follows, just to round things out.
