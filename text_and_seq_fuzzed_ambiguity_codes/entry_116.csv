Dis is it. The big one. Or small. Who knows. Bits of code. Like a puzzle. But not really. More like just, bits. Got them all here. For later. Maybe. Or maybe not. Just writing it down. Important? Prolly. Or not. Anyway. Next task. Laundry. Always laundry. So many socks. Where do they go? Mystery. Like this. DNA. All letters. No spaces. Just blob of letters. Crazy. But also like, makes sense. Some sense. I guess. Gotta move on.","In the quiet hum of the laboratory, beneath the gentle glow of the microscope, Dr. Aris felt a familiar thrill.
