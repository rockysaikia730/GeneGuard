The lab assistant, bless her heart, was muttering about the protocols again. ""It's always the same thing! Buffer A, buffer B... and then... oh gods, the sequence."" She pulled out the printout, squinting. Then she read the sequence: . She scribbled a note - check on the annealing temp!  And then she went to get some coffee. So yeah, that was pretty much the end of it.
