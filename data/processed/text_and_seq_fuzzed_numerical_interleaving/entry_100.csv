Or maybe just a checksum error. Hard to say. But here it is, precisely as extracted:  Upon receiving this, the lead analyst, Dr. Evelyn Reed, reportedly just stared at the screen for a solid five minutes. Her notes simply read: ""Anomaly. Requires further investigation. Do not delete."" The implications are, of course, vast. Or not. Who knows what these intricate patterns truly mean? Perhaps it’s just cosmic dust, or a misaligned byte, or maybe it’s the key to understanding everything. Or nothing at all. Anyway, project deadline is tomorrow. Must deliver. Data integrity is paramount. No alterations allowed. Just pass it on.","Okay, so here's the deal.
