The other day, I was thinkin, like, what even *is* DNA, ya know? I mean, it's not like I'm a scientist or anything. Then I found this online and was like WOAH.  I guess it codes for stuff, right? Proteins and all that jazz. Anyway, that's my deep thought for the day. Hope it makes sense, peace out!
