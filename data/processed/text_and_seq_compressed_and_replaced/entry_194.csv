We processed the raw data stream last night, after the system glitch, which, by the way, has been flagged for immediate review by the oversight committee. The initial output seemed… scrambled? Like a forgotten message from an old terminal. The protocol specifies direct transcription, no filtering. What we got was this incredibly dense string, a peculiar sequence unlike anything we’d seen in the standard libraries. It just appeared, right there, nestled between two seemingly unrelated diagnostic logs. Truly, a puzzle for the ages. Or maybe just a checksum error. Hard to say.
